      The study of radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas, 
       garnered significant attention due to its potential health hazards 
       when accumulated in enclosed spaces. One approach to understanding radon's
        behavior and devising effective mitigation strategies is through the
         construction and characterization of mini radon chambers. These chambers 
         serve as controlled environments for simulating radon accumulation and decay
          processes, allowing researchers to explore various factors influencing radon 
          concentration levels. <span class="not-italic text-blue-800 tracking-tight font-bold leading-loose line-through"> paper provides an overview of the construction and 
          characterization of a mini radon chamber, emphasizing</span> its importance in 
          studying radon behavior and its implications for indoor air quality assessment and radiation protection.

    The aim of this project  is to create, build, and evaluate a miniature radon chamber 
    that can replicate the processes of radon build-up and degradation in regulated settings.

Building a radon chamber provides a controlled environment for conducting research, 
testing radon measurement devices, evaluating mitigation strategies, and educating individuals 
about radon risks and mitigation techniques.
